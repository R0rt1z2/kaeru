This repository contains an ARMv7 payload that provides arbitrary code execution on MediaTek bootloaders (LK).

## Overview
>[!CAUTION]
> If you don't know what you're doing, **you can brick your device**. This is not a beginner's project. Please **[READ THE DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/kaeru/wiki)** carefully and understand the implications of modifying your bootloader.

Given a bootloader image, this tool will output a patched version that can be flashed to the device. The patched image will contain a custom payload that allows you to run arbitrary code during the boot process.

Things to keep in mind:
- This payload is designed for devices using an **ARMv7** Little Kernel (LK) as their bootloader.
- Offsets and addresses are specific to the device and bootloader version. You may need to adjust them for your specific device and bootloader version.

The following list showcases the most common use cases for `kaeru`:
- **Advanced debugging**: Use the payload to debug the boot process of your device by hooking into the bootloader's functions and variables.
- **Custom fastboot commands**: Add your own fastboot commands to the bootloader.
- **Remap button combinations**: You can set up custom boot modes and key combinations to enter different modes (e.g., recovery, fastboot, etc.).
- **Remove bootloader warnings**: Remove the "unlocked bootloader" warning that appears when the device is booted with an unlocked bootloader.
